      <h1>Notes on: Coffee</h1>
<p>This is an attempt to document some of the methods I use to brew myself coffee.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that (like many things) coffee is subject to a lot of personal
preference. Things I like doing may not be the best for you, so feel free to
adjust as needed.</p>
<p>I mostly drink filtered coffee, using a v60, with a preference towards lighter,
more acidic roasts. Almost all of the coffee I make at home I take black, but
I'll sometimes get oat milk with iced coffee at coffee shops.</p>
<h2>Gear (updated 2021 Jul)</h2>
<p>I've provided links to these products on Amazon, but if possible, consider
purchasing from a local coffee shop to help support them!</p>
<p>If you have a good US-based distributor I can link to instead of Amazon,
feel free to <a href="mailto:me@renodubois.com">email me</a> and I'll update these links.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brewer: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Coffee-Dripper-Silver-VDM-02HSV/dp/B00BD1N8WC/">Hario v60, metal</a></li>
<li>Kettle: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bonavita-BV382510V-Variable-Temperature-Gooseneck/dp/B005YR0F40/">Bonavita Electric Gooseneck Kettle</a></li>
<li>Grinder: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/">Baratza Encore</a></li>
<li>Carafé: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Glass-Coffee-Server-1000ml/dp/B001V7NN1Y/">Hario Glass Server</a> (there's a slightly smaller 600ml version by Hario that would also work well)</li>
<li>Insulated Carafé: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HARIO-VHS-60B-Double-Vacuum-Structure/dp/B071JDP87N/">Hario Double Walled Server</a></li>
<li>Filters: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CAFEC-Cone-shaped-Universal-Disposable-Eco-Friendly/dp/B076MCYZ9R/">CAFEC Abaca Coffee Paper Filters</a></li>
<li>Scale: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Scale-Waterproof-Scales-Espresso/dp/B07JG1PXLC/">Apexstone Kitchen Scale</a>
<ul>
<li>I'd recommend any scale that has 0.1g precision. A timer is nice too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coffee Bean Storage: <a href="https://fellowproducts.com/products/atmos-vacuum-canister">Fellow Atmos Vacuum Canister (1.2L size)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I'm pretty happy with my gear. The only upgrade I'd consider is a
nicer kettle, likely the <a href="https://fellowproducts.com/products/staggekg">Fellow Stagg EKG</a>, but it's not high on my list of
things to get.</p>
<h2>Beans</h2>
<p>I use a variety of beans. If I buy locally I usually buy from these roasters:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blueprintcoffee.com/store/">Blueprint Coffee</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sumpcoffee.com/collections/whole-bean-coffee">Sump Coffee</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.coffeestamp.com/collections/all">Coffeestamp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://kaldiscoffee.com/collections/coffee">Kaldi's Coffee</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://www.drinktrade.com/">Trade</a> subscription, which sends
me coffee from a variety of roasters. It's about the same cost as buying local,
which makes it a good way to try new beans easily. If you'd like to try it,
I have a <a href="http://s.trdcfe.me/3qrdgP">referral code</a> that will get you a
discounted first bag, and gives me a small kickback. I'm not sponsored by Trade
or anything, I just like the service.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>For my v60, I generally use one of two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>James Hoffman's Ultimate v60 Technique <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo">(video)</a></li>
<li>Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6 Method <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCW8xSWGZY">(video)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'll make my own written versions of these at some point, but you can watch
those videos if you're interested. The 4:6 Method has started to be my go-to
in the mornings, it's really interesting and can be easily varied to make the
coffee taste quite different. If you're used to &quot;normal&quot; v60 methods, I'd
recommend giving it a try some time.</p>
